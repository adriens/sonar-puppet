<p>Proper indentation is a simple and effective way to improve the code's readability. Consistent indentation among the developers on a team also reduces the differences that are committed to source control systems, making code reviews easier.</p>
<p>This rule checks that the code is properly indented with two whitespaces.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
file { '/tmp/foo':
 ensure => present,  # Noncompliant
   owner => 'foo',
}

file {
  '/tmp/foo1':
    ensure => present,
    owner => 'foo';

    '/tmp/foo2':        # Noncompliant
    ensure => present,
      owner => 'foo';   # Noncompliant
}

class abc (
  $a,
    $b,      # Noncompliant
) { ... }

$a = [
  'a',
    'b',   # Noncompliant
  'c',
]

$a = {
  'a' => '1',
    'b' => '2',  # Noncompliant
  'c' => '3',
}

file {
  [ 'abc',             # Noncompliant
  'def',]:              # Noncompliant
  ensure => present,
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
file { '/tmp/foo':
  ensure => present,
  owner => 'foo',
}

file {
  '/tmp/foo1':
    ensure => present,
    owner => 'foo';

  '/tmp/foo2':
    ensure => present,
    owner => 'foo';
}

class abc (
  $a,
  $b,
) { ... }

$a = [
  'a',
  'b',
  'c',
]

$a = {
  'a' => '1',
  'b' => '2',
  'c' => '3',
}

file {[
  'abc',
  'def',
]:
  ensure => present,
}
