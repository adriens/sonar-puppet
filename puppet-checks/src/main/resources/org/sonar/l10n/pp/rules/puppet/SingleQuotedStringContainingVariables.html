<p>Single quoted strings do not get interpolated. Thus, embedding variables in single quoted strings is useless. Strings containing variables should be surrounded with double quotes instead.</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
warning 'Variable ${my_var} is undefined'
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
warning "Variable ${my_var} is undefined"
</pre>

<h2>Notes</h2>
If the string is to be interpolated by another tool (and not by Puppet), to avoid confusion and make it explicit, prefer:
<pre>
$to_be_interpolated_by_another_tool = "\${git_branch}"
</pre>
to
<pre>
$to_be_interpolated_by_another_tool = '${git_branch}'
</pre>
A comment in this case might also make sense to clarify the intent.
