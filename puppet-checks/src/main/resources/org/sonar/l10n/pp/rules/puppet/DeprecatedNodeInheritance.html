<p>
    Node inheritance is deprecated since version 3.7 and no longer supported since version 4.
</p>

<h2>Non compliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
node 'www1.example.com' inherits 'common' {
  include ntp
  include apache
}
</pre>

<h2>What to Use Instead</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Node inheritance often causes ambiguous or counterintuitive behavior. More effective code reuse can be achieved using classes and defined types.</li>
    <li>Most users who need hierarchical data should keep it in an external source and have their manifests look it up. The best solution right now is <a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/latest">Hiera</a>, which is available by default in Puppet 3 and later. See our <a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/latest">Hiera guides</a> for more information about using it.</li>
    <li><a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/external_nodes.html">ENCs</a> can look up data from any arbitrary source and return it to Puppet as top-scope variables.</li>
    <li>If you have node-specific data in an external CMDB, you can easily write <a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/custom_functions.html">custom Puppet functions</a> to query it.</li>
    <li>For very small numbers of nodes, you can copy and paste to make complete node definitions for special-case nodes.</li>
</ul>
