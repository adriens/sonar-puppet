<p>
    Classes and defined resource types must not be defined within other classes or defined types. Classes and defines should be declared as close to node scope as possible. If you have a class or define which requires another class or define, graceful failures must be in place if those required classes or defines are not declared elsewhere.

<pre>
class apache {
    class ssl { ... }
}

<h2>Also Very Bad</h2>

<pre>
class apache {
  define config() { ... }
}
